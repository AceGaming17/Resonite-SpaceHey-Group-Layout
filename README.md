# Resonite-SpaceHey-Group-Layout
HTML Layout for my Unofficial Resonite Group on SpaceHey.
## What is SpaceHey?
SpaceHey is a retro social network focused on privacy and customizability. It's a friendly place to have fun, meet friends, and be creative.
<br>
TLDR It's a recreation of MySpace.
## Why are you doing this?
SpaceHey is a platform for everyone. And that includes people who play Resonite. And it allows people who don't know the game to learn more about it!
## Why open source this?
I only know so much about HTML and CSS. Anyone can contribute and add on to the layout and information.
## How can I help?
- Go to this website: https://tommypanzram.neocities.org/ (This is a layout editor for SpaceHey.)
- Click on the profile drop down and select "Group"
- For CSS, go to the HTML file in the repo and get <style> through </style> (This is in charge of the customization.)
<br>
Once you're done make sure to submit a pull request if you would like your changes to be seen on the Group Page.
## That's cool and all, but where can I find the group page?
You can find the group page at it's current state here:
