# Resonite SpaceHey Group Layout
This is an HTML Layout for my Unofficial Resonite Group on SpaceHey.
## What is SpaceHey?
SpaceHey is a retro social network focused on privacy and customizability. It's a friendly place to have fun, meet friends, and be creative.
<br>
TLDR It's a recreation of MySpace.
## Why are you doing this?
SpaceHey is a platform for everyone. And that includes people who play Resonite. And it allows people who don't know the game to learn more about it!
## Why open source this?
I only know so much about HTML and CSS. Anyone can contribute and add on to the layout and information.
## How can I help?
- Go to this website: https://tommypanzram.neocities.org/ (This is a layout editor for SpaceHey.)
- Click on the profile drop down and select "Group"
- For CSS, go to the CSS file in the repo and copy and paste into the "CSS" part of the editor (This is in charge of the customization.)
- For HTML, go to the HTML file in the repo and copy and pase into the "Group Content" part of the editor (This is in charge of the main content.)

Once you're done make sure to make a fork and submit a pull request if you would like your changes to be seen on the Group Page.

## That's cool and all, but where can I find the group page?
You can find the group page at it's current state here:
