# Resonite-SpaceHey-Group-Layout
HTML Layout for my Unofficial Resonite Group on SpaceHey.
## What is SpaceHey?
SpaceHey is a retro social network focused on privacy and customizability. It's a friendly place to have fun, meet friends, and be creative.
TLDR It's a recreation of MySpace.
## Why are you doing this?
SpaceHey is a platform for everyone. And that includes people who play Resonite. And it allows people who don't know the game to learn more about it!
## Why open source this?
I only know so much about HTML and CSS. Anyone can contribute and add on to the layout and details.
